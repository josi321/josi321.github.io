                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"> On paper, after graduating from high school I was a pre-med student with intentions to go into dentistry. My experience with data and statistics in university exposed me to programming as a career. I began exploring coding with online courses and I am about to graduate from RED Academy's 12-Week Full Time Web Developemnt Professional course (in fact, I built this website from scratch). I am looking for opportunities to continue to grow as developer, and bring my enthusiaum for problem solving to my first development role. </h3>

                                      I completed their tough assignments, while taking on additional challenges to grow my new skill sets such as mocha and chai testing frameworks for a job application. In class I learned how to interact with web API's, create custom themes and plugins from scratch, and demonstrated leadership as project lead for the development of Sage Canada's website.</p>
